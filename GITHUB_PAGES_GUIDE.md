## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Web Interface (Recommended for Beginners)

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Choose a repository name:
   - For personal site: `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your GitHub username)
   - For project site: any name (e.g., `remarkable-optimizer`)
5. Set repository to **Public**
6. Click **"Create repository"**

#### Step 2: Upload Your Files

1. In your new repository, click **"uploading an existing file"** or **"Add file" → "Upload files"**
2. Drag and drop all files from the `/home/user/deployment/` folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `css/` folder (with all CSS files)
   - `js/` folder (with all JS files)
   - `.nojekyll` file (important!)
   - `README.md`
   - All other files
3. Add a commit message (e.g., "Initial deployment")
4. Click **"Commit changes"**

#### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository **Settings**
2. Scroll down to the **"Pages"** section in the left sidebar
3. Under **"Source"**, select:
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`)
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

#### Step 4: Access Your Site

Your site will be available at:
- Personal site: `https://username.github.io/`
- Project site: `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`

### Method 2: Git Command Line

#### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
cd /home/user/deployment
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment of reMarkable Document Optimizer"
```

#### Step 2: Connect to GitHub

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

Follow Step 3 from Method 1 above.

---

### Method 3: GitHub Actions (Advanced)

For automated deployments with custom workflows:

1. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repository
2. Use the following workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./
```

---

## Important Files

### .nojekyll File

The `.nojekyll` file is **critical** for this deployment. It:
- Prevents Jekyll processing (GitHub's default static site generator)
- Ensures all files are served exactly as they are
- Allows files/folders with underscores to be served

**Status:** ✅ Already included in your deployment package

---

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify your site:

1. **Access the URL** - Visit your GitHub Pages URL
2. **Check the interface** - Ensure the page loads correctly
3. **Test file upload** - Try uploading a test document
4. **Check console** - Open browser DevTools (F12) and check for errors
5. **Test CDN libraries** - Verify all external libraries load
6. **Mobile test** - Check responsiveness on mobile devices

---

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. Go to repository **Settings → Pages**
2. Under **"Custom domain"**, enter your domain
3. Click **"Save"**
4. Configure DNS records with your domain provider:
   - Add CNAME record pointing to `username.github.io`
   - Or add A records pointing to GitHub's IP addresses

---

## Updating Your Site

To update your deployed site:

### Via Web Interface:
1. Navigate to the file you want to update
2. Click the pencil icon to edit
3. Make changes and commit

### Via Git:
```bash
# Make your changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Update description"
git push
```

Changes will be live within 1-2 minutes.

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading

**Problem:** 404 error or blank page  
**Solutions:**
- Verify `.nojekyll` file is present
- Check that `index.html` is in the root directory
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
- Wait 2-3 minutes after initial deployment

### CSS/JS Not Loading

**Problem:** Unstyled page or JavaScript errors  
**Solutions:**
- Verify all paths are relative (not absolute)
- Check that `css/` and `js/` folders are uploaded
- Open browser console (F12) to see specific errors
- Ensure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### CDN Libraries Not Loading

**Problem:** Console errors about external scripts  
**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify CDN URLs are accessible
- Check browser console for specific errors
- All CDN links use HTTPS (already configured)

### Changes Not Appearing

**Problem:** Updates not showing on live site  
**Solutions:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to rebuild
- Check commit was successful in repository
- Try incognito/private browsing mode

---

## Performance Tips

1. **Enable caching** - GitHub Pages automatically caches static assets
2. **Use CDN libraries** - Already configured for optimal performance
3. **Optimize images** - If you add images, compress them first
4. **Monitor bandwidth** - Stay within 100 GB/month limit

---

## Security Notes

- ✅ HTTPS is automatically enabled
- ✅ All CDN resources use HTTPS
- ✅ No server-side processing (inherently secure)
- ✅ Client-side only (files never leave user's device)
- ⚠️ Repository must be public for free GitHub Pages
