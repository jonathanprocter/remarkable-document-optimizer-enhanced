## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Git Integration (Recommended)

This is the **recommended method** for Vercel deployments.

#### Step 1: Push to Git Repository

First, push your code to a Git repository:

```bash
cd /home/user/deployment
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment of reMarkable Document Optimizer"

# Create a repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket, then:
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 2: Create Vercel Account

1. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click **"Sign Up"**
3. Sign up with:
   - GitHub (recommended)
   - GitLab
   - Bitbucket
   - Email

#### Step 3: Import Project

1. After logging in, click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
2. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
3. Authorize Vercel to access your repositories
4. Select your repository from the list
5. Click **"Import"**

#### Step 4: Configure Project

Vercel will auto-detect your project settings:

- **Framework Preset:** Other (or leave as detected)
- **Root Directory:** `./` (leave as default)
- **Build Command:** Leave empty (static site, no build needed)
- **Output Directory:** Leave empty or `.`
- **Install Command:** Leave empty

Click **"Deploy"**

#### Step 5: Wait for Deployment

1. Vercel will deploy your site (usually 30-60 seconds)
2. You'll see a success screen with your live URL
3. Your site is live at: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

---

### Method 2: Vercel CLI

For command-line deployment:

#### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

#### Step 2: Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

Enter your email and verify through the link sent to your inbox.

#### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
cd /home/user/deployment
vercel
```

Follow the prompts:
- Set up and deploy? **Y**
- Which scope? Select your account
- Link to existing project? **N** (for first deployment)
- What's your project's name? Enter a name (e.g., `remarkable-optimizer`)
- In which directory is your code located? `./`
- Want to override settings? **N**

#### Step 4: Deploy to Production

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Your site is now live!

---

### Method 3: Drag and Drop (Quick Test)

For quick testing without Git:

1. Go to [https://vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Look for **"Deploy from template"** or manual upload option
3. Note: Vercel primarily focuses on Git-based deployments
4. For best experience, use Method 1 (Git Integration)

---

## Configuration File

### vercel.json

Your deployment includes a `vercel.json` file with:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Strict-Transport-Security",
          "value": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
        },
        {
          "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
          "value": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com; ..."
        },
        // ... more security headers
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Already configured and included

This file provides:
- Security headers for enhanced protection
- Routing configuration
- Caching strategies for static assets

---

## Custom Domain Setup

To use your own domain:

#### Step 1: Add Domain in Vercel

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click **"Settings"** → **"Domains"**
3. Enter your domain name
4. Click **"Add"**

#### Step 2: Configure DNS

Vercel will provide DNS configuration instructions:

**For root domain (example.com):**
- Add A record: `@` → `76.76.21.21`

**For subdomain (www.example.com):**
- Add CNAME record: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`

#### Step 3: Verify Domain

1. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, usually minutes)
2. Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificate
3. HTTPS is enabled automatically

---

## Project Management

### Rename Project

1. Go to **Settings** → **General**
2. Under **"Project Name"**, click **"Edit"**
3. Enter new name
4. Click **"Save"**

### Environment Variables

If you need environment variables later:

1. Go to **Settings** → **"Environment Variables"**
2. Add key-value pairs
3. Select environments (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Redeploy for changes to take effect

### Preview Deployments

For Git-connected projects:
- Every push to a branch creates a preview deployment
- Every pull request gets a unique preview URL
- Test changes before merging to production
- Automatic cleanup after merge

---

## Automatic Deployments

Once connected to Git:

### Production Deployments
- Push to `main` branch → Automatic production deployment
- Live at: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Preview Deployments
- Push to any other branch → Preview deployment
- Unique URL for each branch/commit
- Perfect for testing

### Deployment Workflow

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push

# Vercel automatically:
# 1. Detects the push
# 2. Builds and deploys
# 3. Notifies you when complete (30-60 seconds)
```

---

## Verification Steps

After deployment:

1. **Access the URL** - Visit your Vercel URL
2. **Check the interface** - Ensure page loads correctly
3. **Test functionality** - Try uploading a test document
4. **Check console** - Open DevTools (F12) for errors
5. **Verify CDN** - Ensure all external libraries load
6. **Test mobile** - Check responsive design
7. **Check headers** - Use Network tab to verify security headers
8. **Test preview** - Create a branch and verify preview deployment
